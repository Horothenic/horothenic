The most important tool in my life.
<!--more-->

**[Habitica](https://habitica.com)**

I can't remember since when I use it but thanks to it I achieve my goals on time, never forget to do anything, can prioritize my tasks and I can control if I am getting too much weight for me or if I have room to do more.

This magical site that saved my forgetful brain to take a handle in real life and do stuff instead of forgetting to do it.

*(Actually I found out I know since when I use it, 30/06/2016)*

### **WHY**

The main reason **Habitica** is so delightful is that the design is so neat and simple, you can add and remove stuff so easily, you can program things to show different days a week, month or year, so you don't forget **ANYTHING**.

Is based on 4 different types of tasks:
- **Habits** - Things you want to reward or punish yourself if you do but are optional on your day.
- **Dailies** - Things you want to do on schedule, like something you want to do every day or once every week.
- **To Dos** - Things you said will do and do not want to forget, set to an specific day in the future.
- **Rewards** - Things you want to reward yourself if you get enough coins (I don't use this section much tho).

On top of that you can create parties, guilds and collect a **VAST** amount of pixel art pets, mounts and equipoment for your avatar, is simply beautiful.

### **HOW**

Every time I say **YES** to some plan or thing or I see a new habit I want in myself I add it here, and every hour or so every day I see my list and check what I can complete, rarely I go to sleep without checking if I missed something, that way I can plan extra if I did.

My dashboard looks like this.

I use the format ***[CATEGORY] - [Task]*** to keep a track of things related to each other more easily.

When I am working I take little rests of 5 - 15 min every 45 - 60 minutes, this give me enough time to do a lot of things around the house and also keeps me concentrated, and most importantly to check **Habitica** and see if I have something missing for the day.

### **RESULTS**

My days started to be like **500%** more productive, I even add time with friends there, recreation is important too, my friendships flourished, my family is happier with me being in more contact, my extra activities feel amazingly coordinated and I grow in a steady pase, personally and professionally.

I thank **Habitica** to create such a beautiful tool.

### **CONCLUSION**

If you struggle with organizing your life and ToDo lists seem pretty dull to you, try this out, is so much fun, send me a DM, my user is **@Horothenic** have fun being productive.
