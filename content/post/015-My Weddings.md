I had 2 very different weddings in my International marriage.
<!--more-->

My weddings happened in April 2024, so I am many months in the future now, but I did not have the time to write this with the care it needs.

Well, let start with the story...

I had 2 weddings, one in Mexico and one in Brazil, that is because I married a brazilian woman (duh!).

### FIRST WEDDING

My first wedding wasa **Costume Wedding**, everyone had a costume, even us, we did not have a banquet, we paid for Hot Dogs, Tacos and Corn carts to feed the 160 guests.

When we started planning we obviously wanted a fun wedding but we had just a third of the budget for it!!! That is because we still needed money to pay the flights to Brazil and the second wedding, so saving money as much as possible was very desirable.

We found a cheap but pretty venue, had very tasty food and all our friends, thats all we needed, the rest was a bonus. In fact when I told my Dad about the **Costume wedding** he was frightened it was going to be shit!! At the end he enjoyed the wedding very much and was surprised how good it was, because **IT WAS AMAZING!!**.

The wedding took 7 hours to finish and in my mind only 1 hour passed, it was incredibly fun and enjoyable... I loved my wedding.

My dear **Camille** was a beautiful medieval princess while I was a steampunk gentleman, out costumes were expensive but they were worth every penny.

Here are some photos.

Everyone attended with a costume, no one failed, the wedding looked amazing!!!

Only regrest one thing... we chose to not have a professional photographer for this wedding, we have a lot of amazing photos but no one in high quality, fortunetely the second wedding did, so we have some high quality photos but not of **Mexico** wedding.

### SECOND WEDDING

Now the second wedding, first we needed to travel to **Brazil**, specifically to **Florian√≥polis**, the cleanest, most amazing, better cared for city I have ever seen, I stil don't understand why my wife prefer to live in **Guadalajara** instead of that magnificent city... maybe one day I will convince her to go back.

This wedding was smaller, cause Camille family is also smaller, my family is freaking huge compared to hers.

The wedding was very chill, we even had some **Capibaras** resting in the beach inside the venue, the sky was gray and rain was iminent.

We were lucky and it started raining just after we said ***" I accept you as my wife"***, felt like a miracle.

We ate a lot of chocolate and popcorn since there were no banquet either (remember, saving money was important), and we took a lot of amazing high quiality pictures this time, talked with all the family.

I forgot something important on the Mexico wedding, Camille's parents and brother were in Mexico for the wedding, and my parents were in the Brazil one, sadly my brother and sister could not make it...

I presented my family to Camille's family and she presented her to mine, these moments will be treasured in my heart forever.

We used the same costumes and we looked amazing!!!! (it was very hot and we sweat a lot but was worth it).

Here are some photos.

## CONCLUSION

My wife says it was not worth the 2 weddings, that maybe just 1 would have been enough, but I disagree, I want her family to know that I care about them, I am connected to their family now... it was my duty to include them in our celebrations.

I would do it again every time.

I love Camille... more than anything, she means to me more than she can imagine. Being married to her is just a step in our life adventure, I chose well... she is... marvelous.

The following text is meant for her, lets see how much time it will take her to read this haha

***Go give me a kiss right now, cause I love you very very much.***
