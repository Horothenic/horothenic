### **Introduction**

I am a game developer that wanted to share stuff in articles and to have a personal showcase of its work and acomplishments, and then I discovered that it is super easy to set an static website using **[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)** and **[Zeit](https://vercel.com/)** using **GitHub** as server.

Now I can share all the things I want on my terms.

### **Me**

This is me!, I do not taking photos very much, this one here and some with my girlfriend are all I have to show.

The phrase that until this day is my **life motto**, the phrase the more I hear it the more I think is an excellent way to achieve happiness, the phrase I am most surprised I found in a zombie comedy movie.

> *Enjoy the little things.*  ***- Columbus from Zombieland***

### **My objective**

I want to develop games that evokes intense feelings in the players, like **Nintendoland** when I played with my work friends for 6 hours straight, like the first time I played **Halo** with my cousin and unraveled its secrets, like the first time I defeated the **Pokemon** League when I was 9 years old or when I cried living the magnificent story in **Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons**.

All games can give a feeling of **achievement** or **success**, but the games that give more than that are the games that will be in your memory forever and will make you more human.

And my current objective is to make **one** of those games, one I can enjoy playing with my friends when we gather, my **party** game.

### **Communities**

I have been part of the following communities.

* **Unity User Group GDL** (since its foundation in 2015)  
**Member** (Patreon)  
I attend it monthly and sometimes I get in the **Discord** channel.

* **Rotary International** (Oct 2015 - Dec 2019)  
**Rotaract**  
I paused my membership because I was tired it can get super burocratic.

* **AIESEC** (Dec 2018 - Jan 2019)  
**IGE**  
I ended my partnership in just one month because everyone in the organization behaved super joyful, too joyful to my taste.
