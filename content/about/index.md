### **Introduction**

I am a game developer that wanted to share stuff in articles and to have a personal showcase of its work and acomplishments, and then I discovered that it is super easy to set a static website using **[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)** and **[Vercel](https://vercel.com/)** using **GitHub** as server.

Now I can share all the things I want on my own terms.

### **Me**

This is me!, I do not like my picture taken very much, so there are just a few around.

The phrase that, until this day is my **life motto**, that the more I hear it the more I think is an excellent way to achieve happiness and I am most surprised I found in a zombie comedy movie.

> *"Enjoy the little things."*  ***- Columbus from Zombieland***

Is my anthem for life.

### **My objective**

I want to develop games that evokes intense feelings in the players, like when I played **Nintendoland** with my work friends for 6 hours straight, like the first time I played **Halo** with my cousin and unraveled it's secrets, the time I defeated the **Pokemon** League when I was 9 years old, or when I cried living the magnificent story in **Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons**.

All games can give a feeling of **achievement** or **success**, but the games that give more than that are the games that will be in your memory forever and will make you more human.

And my current objectives are to make **one** of those games, one I can enjoy playing with my friends when we gather, my **party** game, and to get into **AAA** level development teams to become one of them and master my art.
