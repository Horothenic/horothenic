A teacher will always be needed.
<!--more-->

I became a teacher in [Amerike](https://amerike.edu.mx) university, they invited me and since I want to become a full time teacher when I get older I decided to start little teaching some classes once in a while.

This time I am teaching in a workshop class, the objective of this class is for the students to create a game within their **skills** but this time instead of a free for all environment, I am giving them **professional environment** roles for them to start learning some rules that will boost their development career in the future.

Being a teacher means you are a mentor, someone that have more **experience** and **knowledge** on a certain field pass it to people with less, I find this reassuring and wonderful, is one of the thing that makes us humans so badass, we can pass knowledge on and on, improving the world with more capable people.

I love to teach, it fills my soul with **excitement**.

And very important, it also fill your **ego** a bit, being the smartest in the room fells great too, but try to don't abuse of that, you have years of experience compared to your students.

If you get the chance to be a teacher full of half time, try it, it may be demanding at first but you will enjoy it eventually.
