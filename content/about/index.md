### **Introduction**

I am a game developer that wanted to share stuff in articles and to have a personal showcase of its work and acomplishments, and then I discovered that it is super easy to set an static website using **[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)** and **[Zeit](https://vercel.com/)** using **GitHub** as server.

Now I can share all the things I want on my terms.

### **Me**

This is me!

![This is me][1]

---------------

### **My objective**

I want to develop games that evokes intense feelings in the players, like **Nintendoland** when I played with my work friends for 6 hours straight, like the first time I played **Halo** with my cousin and unravled its secrets, like the first time I defeated the **Pokemon** League when I was 9 years old or like when I cried in **A Tale of Two brothers** when I got to the end.

All games can give a feeling of **achievement**, but the games that give more than that are the games that will be in your memory forever and will make you more human.

And my current objective is to make **one** of those games that I can enjoy playing with my friends in reunions, a **party** game.
