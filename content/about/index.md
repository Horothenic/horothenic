### **Introduction**

I am a game developer that wanted to share stuff in articles and to have a personal showcase of its work and acomplishments, and then I discovered that it is super easy to set a static website using **[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)** and **[Vercel](https://vercel.com/)** using **GitHub** as server.

Now I can share all the things I want on my own terms.

### **Me**

This is me!, I do not like my picture taken very much, so there are just a few around.

The phrase that, until this day is my **life motto**, that the more I hear it the more I think is an excellent way to achieve happiness and I am most surprised I found in a zombie comedy movie.

> *"Enjoy the little things."*  ***- Columbus from Zombieland***

Is my life motto.

### **My objective**

I want to develop games that evokes intense feelings in the players, like when I played **Nintendoland** with my work friends for 6 hours straight, like the first time I played **Halo** with my cousin and unraveled it's secrets, the time I defeated my first **Pokemon** League when I was 9 years old, or when I cried living the magnificent story in **Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons**, or the time I got addicted to the lore of **Dark Souls**, **Elden Ring**, **Guild Wars 2** or **Tibia**.

All games can give a feeling of **achievement** or **success**, but the games that give more than that are the games that will be in your memory forever and will make you more human.

And my current objective is to collaborate on **one** of those games, one that I can really be proud of.
