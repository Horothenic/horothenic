The best story ever told.
<!--more-->

The story of a stupid pirate kid that wishes to become pirate king, and one story that is so vast, interesting and carrying good values that I think is a **MUST** see/read for any anime fan.

You can read more about why it is called by some ***"The best story ever told"*** [here](https://www.thegamer.com/one-piece-story-generation/).

For me is more than just a story, for the years I have been reading this week by week, I started to see it when I was in high school (13 years ago), it had already more than 300 episodes and I started from episode 1, little by little I was engulfed by its incredible well made universe and lore.

When I finished my bachelor degree (8 years ago) I switched to read the manga instead, since I was so hungry for more One Piece, it was the first manga I read and from then on I preferred reading manga that watching it.

It has now **1061 manga chapters**, it is insane!!!!

And even when I recommend starting from episode 1 from the anime.... it will take years to get to final episode, I you gonna start watch a summary and start from episode 900 at least, on that point One Piece don't look like 25 years old anime and you will enjoy it, maybe later you will check more detailed summaries to learn the whole thing.

#### **Short summary**

Same thing but in spanish but detailed with good humor.

#### **Main Characters**

All characters are very unique and have an specific dream they all thrive to get, and from the beginning we all knew we will only get 10 crew members plus Luffy.
- **Luffy** - Become pirate king.
- **Zoro** - Become best swordsman in the world.
- **Nami** - Map the entire world.
- **Usopp** - Become a brave warrior of the sea.
- **Sanji** - Find the All Blue (a place where all oceans meet).
- **Chopper** - Cure all illnesses.
- **Robin** - Learn true story of the world.
- **Franky** - Build the strongest ship and travel the world on it.
- **Brook** - Return to Laboon (a whale that is waiting for him) and sing him a song.
- **Jinbe** - Equality among fishmen and humans. ***(NOT CONFIRMED)***
- **Yamato** - Travel the world and teach the Oden way. ***(NOT CONFIRMED)***

#### **World**

The world is a very very big ocean with giant island on it, a giant ring of mountains that goes all around the world and a perpendiular giant line icean that crosses those mountains and also goes around the world, is separates the world in 4 seas, North, East, South and West blue.

What I love about it is that from the very beginning you know all of this, you know the final objective and you can map the route to get it, this makes the reader eager to go to the next step.

#### **Lore**

The world government has erased 100 years of history, and our main characters are unraveling that little by little with their travels, at the end we will know the real history of those 100 years and maybe overthrown the government.

Also from the very beginning we know what people are the strongest and little by little our main characters have faced them and defeated them one by one in order of power, we grow with them.

### **Conclusion**

One Piece have been part of me a long time, and I will regret dying before I know the end of it, really.... is an amazing story, very well told and unique, you will not regret reading/seeing it, this year when **Eichiro Oda** (the mangaka that draw it) announced that the final arc has begun I was so happy that I tattooed something on me to have One Piece forever with me, give it a try.
