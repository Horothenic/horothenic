This one was one of the hardest things I have ever faced.
<!--more-->

### **WHAT HAPPENED?**

I will tell you my side of the story.

This really happened in February 2021, the hardest break up I hope to ever have, let me tell you about it and hopefully it will help someone struggling or my future self can come back here as a reminder.

A lot of things were wrong, out of control, problems kept reviving each time more often, we were starting to have discussions on things that were not happening yet, we knew that our future would not be good for us.

- **She wanted to have a different life style.**
- **I wanted to have a different life style.**

<!--Let me explain that with better detail.

She wanted to have a **wealthy life** to be happy, I wanted to be happy hoping wealth to come along.

She wanted her family to be the **center of attention**, I wanted both families to become friends to each other.

She wanted to have nice **expensive** cars, jewerly and clothes, I don't even like cars that much, jewelry are only rocks for me and fashion is not my strong.-->

She simply wanted a different life than me, we had discussions about money, cars, houses, family, and so on.

I felt like I was the one that needed to get an amazing job to provide for a life that I didn't even want.

<!--And since all of these things are not bad objectives, I actually think those are good ones, the problem was that even when these were hers, I was the one that was supposed to make them a reality.

I also felt like I was the one that needed to get an amazing job so that I could provide a big house, great car and clothes, cause she was not pushing her career forward, and I needed to put her family over mine for her to be in good terms with me.-->

These are **BIG** problems, at that point we were already engaged, we really were getting close to share a life together, and even when we were living together for more than a year at that point, things felt different, at least for me.

She was not just a girlfriend anymore.

- **She became the future mother of my kids.**
- **She became the face I would see every morning.**
- **She became the light in my bad days.**
- **She became the partner in crime and joy.**
- **She became the one that I would grow old with.**

In all these months I have learned that... this was not the case, I became obsessed with her, like she was a godess, I loved her but it was not healthy love.

Every time I got angry was because I was going towards a life I hated, and became desperate.

This feeling made me do bad things, things that I am not proud off, I am not the victim here, we were both executioners of our own relationship, but I think we were fighting for our own happiness without knowing it.

<!--The sad thing is, that I think the bad things I did were easy to fix, but her things were almost impossible.

I was too intrusive in her family affairs, kind of toxic on some.

I was not fair with her friends compared to mine.

I had big doubts before our engagement, now I totally know why.

Bad things, but I really was trying to fix them along the way, she tended to ignore that fact, that I was trying.-->

### **WHAT I LEARNED FROM THIS?**

When analyzing my past relationship in therapy **(I reccommend everyone to consider to have therapy at some point)** I realized that the love for her that grew in me was actually created over very weak pillars.

I havent had a relationship as long as this last one, longest one before was only a couple of months, and having a lot of trouble dating before her, I went **ALL IN** on this relationship... based on **luck and beauty.**

I found her pretty, maybe too pretty, that blinded me, made me say yes to things that I really didn't want, almost unconsciously.

<!--At the end I felt closer to be her slave than to be her loved one, she never made me feel special and unique in front of others, I don't recall a single time when said to me *"**You are the best thing that has ever happened to me**"*, while I said that a lot, all the time.-->

That is not healthy, I totally **forgot about myself** in order to make her happy.

<!--At the end I felt that she meant to me so much and I meant for her **just another boyfriend**, she made me feel like I was disposable.

At the end she wanted time alone to analyze if I was **worthy and enough**, that made me feel like an object that was supposed to work correctly, and for her I were not working anymore.

At the end she was **not willing** to wait for me to go to therapy to fix my flaws, even when it took me not more than 1 month to start fixing things that I have wronged for more than a decade and she did not even tell her closest friends about the situation for advice.-->

It took time but finally I got out of the spell, a spell I do not want to fall in ever again, **toxic and obsessive love**, even in small doses can do a lot of harm.

<!--I learned that she were the selfiest person I have ever met, I think she wants a prince charming, someone that is perfect, unflawed, and has the virtue to ignore all her flaws, because she thinks she don't have any, even when she says she has some.

She even said to me that she cared about me even after the break up, but did some pretty awful things on social media that were clearly directed to me, that made me unfriend her and put her outside of my life for good.-->

### **CONCLUSION**

Life must go on right?

It is not easy but every thing good or bad, teaches us something.

This break up has made me such an incredibly better person, tougher, more resilient, more secure, more observant, kinder, better prepared for life.

The only advice that I would give at this point is, always fight for love, all the way, but do not ignore the love for yourself, in my case I was loving someone but little by little the love for myself was dying.

- **Ask for advice of your friends and family.**
- **Go to therapy, learn about yourself and the flaws that you can't see.**
- **Be humble.**
- **Fight for your dreams.**

I am totally sure the next time I fell in love with someone, I will excel like never before, and one day I will **find the real love of my life**.

And finally, no matter where or with whom she is, I wish her a long and happy life, just not with me again.
