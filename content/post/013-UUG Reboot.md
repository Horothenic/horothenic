It is so nice to have them back.

First, what is **Hacker Garage** and Unity User Group.

Well **Hacker Garage** is a coworking space for makers, developers and any community that embrace teamwork and solidarity, and the **Unity User Group** is a community that focus on game development using Unity.

Many years ago Unity sponsored these communities but now only few remain, and actually we are going to change the name because we want it to be about game dev, not just Unity.

We stopped gathering on March 2020 because of **Covid**, I could not believe it was 3 years ago!!! I went to almost all of the reunions, it was a moment of peace around devs, I talked with my friends and we shared what we were doing, how we were improving and what we wanted for our professional career, I loved to do talks there and that even got me a job in the past!!!

I really missed it, last month y friend Lune rebooted it since **Hacker Garage**, who closed because of Covid, was going to open doors again, with a talk from our Unity friend Arturo Nereu, you can find it on twitter as @arturonereu.

His talk inspired me a lot, after the event I told Lune I wanted to do the next month talk, and then I started working on it.

It took me some time to know what to share, but at the end was easy to choose the topic... I shared about how my career grew in those 3 years that we did not have meetings.

My life had high and lows that I think made me a better human and developer, I just needed a way to share it properly, after writing a very bad and long script for the talk it became obvious the best way would be to have a graphic timeline.

Problem... I did not knew of ana utomatic way to do it, and with enough flexibility so... I coded it on **Unity**!!! I was going to talk in an Unity User Group after all.

Here is the result, very simple using DoTween and a controller I wrote for knowing what to appear and move on every step.

I was very nervous because I was going to talk about personal stuff too, and I did not want to be perceived as a smug... but at the end it went great!!!

People liked how I said that to be a good dev people needed to be good people too, had good values and soft skills, it appears that is not a popular topic... in my opinion that should be discussed more often.

I am so happy that the **User Group** is back!!!

If you read this, consider seriously to share knowledge and experiences to a dev community, you will get friends and probably inspire someone or be inspired yourself.

I just wrote this because I am very glad the User Goup is back.
