I was a very shy person when I was young, and now, in my 20s, one thing remains from that time, my dislike of photos.
<!--more-->

I try to avoid them most of the time.

Sometimes that means telling my family that I want to take the pictures so I can avoid being in the family photo haha, they still make me by force to be in some... and I understand, I canÂ´t be a ghost in the family.

But my reasoning behind avoiding photos is solid and based on the following points:

**1. Most pictures end up never being used and are garbage.**

**2. I believe that a photo must be a reminder of a good memory.**

**3. Good memories deserve to be FULLY experienced, taking photos or videos can ruin it.**

I have seen lots of times people miss part of a concert experience to take a video, and some times they ruin it for more people since they block the view, or when your friend takes 20 photos because she/he did not look beautiful, or people that takes pictures of the mountains and stays on his phone viewing it instead of **living the moment**.

I do not want that to happen to me so I am more cautious when taking one.

### **BUT!!!**

I still do not like to be in the photos hahaha!!!

**I prefer my photos show what I experienced... not me experiencing it**.

That is why I came up with a very **weird**, **stupid** and **fun** solution for me and my loved ones, because they always complained that I do not share my life with them so much.

### **I used a substitute!!**

A literal substitute from Pokemon.

I bought one with my best friend and I have been taking pictures with it **EVERYWHERE**, I even took it to China when I visited in a job trip.

Here is his substitute with mine one time I visited him after a long time.

I really **love** how stupid this is so I continue to share my life this way instead of me, and is so **funny** is an insentive to take more from time to time.

After more than a year doing this, I learned that is very important to share your life with your loved ones, and photos are a very good way to do it.

If I can give any reader an advice is to find a way to share your life in a way you are comfortable with... but share it in some way.

**Thanks for reading**
