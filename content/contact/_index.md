I want to share here the phrase that changed me the most from the moment I heard it, the phrase that until this day is my **life motto**, the phrase the more I hear it the more I think is a very good way to achieve happiness, the phrase I am most surprised I found in a zombie movie.

> *Enjoy the little things.  **- Columbus from Zombieland***
