A little over a year treating myself every week and it has been awesome.
<!--more-->

I have learned that one of the few thing a person can always be proud of spending time in... is caring about **himself/herself**.

On therapy I did not obeyed my therapist like a robot nor accepted only the things I was comfortable with, I listened to a professional while her skills **uncovered and unraveled** my messed up mind.

Everyone has issues, may not be so disrupting but we all have a vision of the person we want to be and we constantly want to achieve that, the issue I have found in myslef is that procrastination, lack of motivation and a fixed routine make horrors in those plans, you keep pushing things days and days, this blog is being written 24 days after I decided to write about this.

I want to become the person I want to be and going to therapy makes my mind feel **powerful** and **stable**, enough to push myself day by day.

I know one day I will not need therapy to push myself, but my mind had some serious issues I did not know how to analyze and therapy helped me on that, to figure out what was wrong and what was right for me, later I was able to choose the best for me and for **my objectives**.

This messege is for my future self, it was a **terrific** idea to go to therapy (even when you started going fo different reasons).

And for anyone that reads this blog, take care of yourself, you will be **happier** than ever.
