I played it 20 years ago and now its back.
<!--more-->

I want to share a game I love so much and why I love it.

This game is so old is hard to explain why I like it so much, it started because of nostalgia, I played this when I was 10 years old, has changed a lot since then and is so much better now.

There I was trying to play a hard game with practically no skill, with no money to play properly since it requires a premium subscription... but it was such a good adventure.

It has been part of my daily routine for like 3 years now, I don't play very much but is like a meditation session when I do, I enjoy doing little things that build up to big achievements, and I do it in the form of 2 major mechanics in the game, but first, let me explain a little bit of what Tibia is like.

### MY CHARACTER

This is me, I am an Elite Knight lvl 286 at the moment I am writing this.

And now the interesting part, the mechanics I love.

### BESTIARY

For a completionist like me a game that gives you hundreds and hundreds of stuff to complete and shows your progress.... is a shot of dopamine every time I complete the kills neccessary to complete the Bestiary of a creature, the thrill I get is inmense and motivates me in my real life (sounds weird but when you start your day with sucess the rest just follows).

### BOSSTIARY

Tibia has a lot of bosses and to complete them all you need a community where all their members thrive for being the lucky one finding a boss, takes days, sometimes weeks to find one, and I found one of those groups, is so much fun work together to get them, we are a great team.

## CONCLUSION

Even when the game is so old, has not so many people playing it, it is very intense and the people playing it are very into it, nothing half baked.

I just wanted to share a little bit of this game, is not popular at all, it was at some point but now is a niche game, be proud of your special games.
