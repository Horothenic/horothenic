### **I WAS HIRED BY VRCHAT!!**

It was a great surprise when I was checking my **LinkedIn** profile and found that I had an invitation to form part of the **VRChat** team.

At this point I only consumed VRChat via youtube videos of a channel named ***Drumsy***.

And the fact I never got in was because I only owned Mac computers and also I did not have a VR headset to enjoy it fully.

But as the geek I am I always dreamed of working with VR, since I first developed a little game back in my first career years and read my favorite book **Ready Player One** *(I think I will need to make a blog entry for this one too)*.

I want to share what it's been like on different aspects.

### **HIGHLIGHTS**
#### **INTERVIEW PROCESS**

From the very beginning was fantastic, the recruiter spoke wonders related to salary and vacation time, the second interview was even more fabulous, a lead engineer asked me questions related to how I handle problems and people on the workplace, I felt incredible because it looked like the company really valued a non toxic environment and was testing me as a person too, not only a developer.

Then I went to the technical interview, a lot of questions of how I handle problems with Unity, code and what was my most difficult task up tothat moment, was given by three developers from different areas so it was quiet the challenge.

Next I had the most surprised interviews, one by the CEO and one by the CTO, the CEO spoke with me about how VRChat was doing and what it thrives for, whle the CTO spoke about the workplace inside VRChat, both were interested iun who I was, not just my background.

At the end I had 5 interviews and I was amazed about the incredible people working there... **I had to get in**.

I started playing VRChat to get used to it right away.

And after one month the interview process started.... I was contacted with an offer to start working... I think that feeling of hapiness and acomplishment is by far the greatest on my professional career, I am proud to be working here.

#### **FIRST MONTH**

I have worked on small and big games, but most for mobile, so getting into a desktop/VR environment was nice, I also enjoyed that the game is so big that you need to think extra steps to dont break things around, architecture is extra important.

I am having a blast working here, the team is so big, I don't now if I ever going to meet all of them correctly.

And my team is great.

#### **VACATIONS**

Is incredible how much paid days I have, sums to 35+ days, and that is not yet counting the vacations I can schedule for myself.

Also just as I entered the team I was told that each year the company pays a retire week for everyone, this yearis going to be here in Mexico, Cancun specifically, and I am very excited to meet everyone in real life (cause I see them on VR all the time).

### **IS THIS MY DREAM JOB?**

It may be it, here I can work in every aspect of the game if I want, I can share my expertise all around and be part of a great VR community.

I cna start working on my main life objective... ***creating experiences that other people can cherish.***

I started to make a pirate world so I can also be a creator for VRChat, I will need to hire someone for my avatar tho, because I don't knoow very much about 3D modeling.

I meet you there as **Horothenic** and have fun on the **Metaverse**.
