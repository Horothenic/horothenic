An amazing site to practice or learn algorithms, you definitely have to train for these.

A while time ago I failed an interview because I did not undersatand at that moment the differences between **class** and **struct**, and how to use **async** and **await** in my code.

After **2 hours** of studying I got the grasp of them and undesrtood how to use them properly, I was completely devastated about my failure, but this teached me a lesson, you must never stop learning the little things, you have to keep learning about your environment and the tools you use everyday.

I made a list, and focused on these:

- **C#**
  - Keywords
  - Concepts
  - Patterns
  - Cleanliness
  - Algorithms
- **Unity**
  - Internal tools
  - Plugins
  - Patterns

The **first part** of C# was easy, I just started reading all the Microsoft official documentation and looked for videos on youtube for the usage of each of the things I did not know, this came with a lot of knowledge about concepts and patterns, the cleanliness was the department I was confortable with, my code is usually very structured and standarized.

The **second part** about Unity is a little more difficult to get good at, because you need to use the things to really understand them, and that takes a lot of time, I have practiced just a bit but I know which tools are available and their purpose, for when I need them I can start right away learning.

The **BIG PROBLEM** was the algorithms part, usually people only train algorithms for interview tests, but **OMG** I completely underestimated them until I tried them.

Algorithms give you combined knowledge on problem solving, that's the thing, is like doing math in the school, you don't do math to be a mathematician, you do ot because that will make you brain better prepared for overall problem solving.

So.... **YOU NEED TO TRAIN ALGORITHMS**.

You are missing a lot if you don't.

And for this I totally recommend **[Algo Expert](https://www.algoexpert.io/)**, I found it after some training videos on Youtube, it cost a little bit but is **TOTALLY WORTH IT**, they explain everything so good, with the solution explained on python with written solutions on every language you can think of, also, gives you a certificate after 100 exercises, the quality of all is amazing, and you can find a lot of famous algorithms, like solving Sudoku or Dijkstra algorithm.

Try it and you will thank me, I am sure.
