One day exploring the internet I found this beautiful **[website](https://www.michaelhemingway.com/)**, I found the creator GitHub profile and forked the website to create a similar one in the future, since I am not a web developer I left that until a better time, it was a surprise when the creator contacted me on **Twitter**.
<!--more-->

 He contacted me regarding the fork, I thought he was excited about it, then I understood he was confused because the project was so tightly made for his website that the possibilites for me to replicate it were almost impossible.

 However he still gave me an advice.

 He told to check static site generators, so I did.

 I found out there were lots frameworks like Middleman or **[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)**, I ended up choosing Hugo because I liked the **[Nederburg](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-nederburg-theme/)** theme.

 The next problem would be the same as every site I have helped to set, the hosting.

 FORTUNATELY while I was looking for static site generators I found that there were sites that could use a GitHub repository as hosting!!!

 Then I found **[Vercel](https://vercel.com/)** formerly known as **Zeit** and I liked the interface very much, so I choose it to host my static site for FREE!!!

I had only one issue deploying for the first time, the **CSS** files were not loading, but I looked it up in Google and found out I needed to add the site domain as **base URL** for it to load them correctly, locally the base URL is overwritten to the localhost so it was working on my computer but not the server.

After I got that figured out, I bought a domain in **Namecheap** and in less than 30 minutes Vercel was redirecting correctly to it.

After that I used my basic knowledge on **CSS**, **Markdown** and **HTML** to edit the basic files, change the colors, add basic information, configure the contact form and add this first post.

And every change I want to **deploy** I only need to push to the **master** branch in the **GitHub** repository.

It is simple, efficient and I would say elegant.

If you want a simple site like this so you can share some stuff or to use it instead of a **curriculum** like me, try it.

I can help you to set it up if you want to, I got this set up in less than 8 hours over past week.

**Good day to you if you read this**
