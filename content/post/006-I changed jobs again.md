Sadly, was not hard to decide, this place is awesome.

My current professional objective is to became a top tier Game Developer and work on **AAA games**, I want to live a lot of experiences, on lots of projects, learn from the bests.

Amber was working with amazing **IPs**, the programmer team was great, the planning team amazing.

The problem was with the **Producers, UX and UI teams**, I think half of the time of programmers was spent on experiments, experiments that could have been easily handled by prototypes in Adobe XD, instead we had to wire new UI all the time, fixing bugs that would be later overwritten by a new experiment.

That... made me quite **angry**, the game could have had so much more time for debugging and fixing at the end, and we needed that time.

Plus to that I never liked they did not pay us with all the standrad law things, it felt almost illegal.

So when I knew from a friend that works in **Globant**, they were looking for Game Developers, we send my CV, for my suprise they offered me almost twice the money I was earning, they tolde me that they do work with AAA games and that the growth there was amazing.

I asked my friend to see if all that was **true** and yes it was, my friend has already jumped a few ranks and is winning so good money, I want growth and money together with my AAA game objective.

It was a no brainer, was a blast working in Amber, but Globant offers me what I really want, I want to stay here so many years, even forver can be reasonable.

Now I am a proud **Globber**, one game at a time.
